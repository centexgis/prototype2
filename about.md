### CENTEXGIS strives to provide the Central Texas GIS community with a forum for networking and growth. Our goal is to strengthen community bonds by bringing together public and private sector GIS professionals for knowledge sharing and support.

We are located in the Austin, TX area and conduct quarterly meetings in central, north, and south Austin. Send us an email if you'd like to join or if you
would like to hear about what we have going on, as well as attend our next meeting.
