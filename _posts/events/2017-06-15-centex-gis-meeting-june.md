### Please mark your calendars and make plans to join us for the upcoming CenTexGIS user group meeting!
<!--more-->

### Date: June 27, 2017
### Time: 3:30 - 5:30pm
### Location: [Austin History Center - 810 Guadalupe St., Austin, TX, 78701](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Austin+History+Center,+Austin+Public+Library/@30.2717133,-97.7469814,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8644b50bc234d3c3:0x2ac89189e352c67e!8m2!3d30.2717133!4d-97.7458871)

We hope you will come out to this important event and meet with local GIS colleagues and friends to learn, network and help strengthen GIS community bonds through knowledge sharing and support. The proposed agenda for the meeting includes a recap of our March meeting workshop results, a GIS Day planning workshop, and several members of the CenTexGIS community will share and rehearse their presentations for the ESRI UC next month in San Diego, CA.

Please try to arrive a few minutes early to find parking, check any bags at entry, and sign in.  The Austin History Center shares a parking lot with the Austin Public Library, and street side metered parking as well as a pay garage across the street are available parking options.

Following the meeting we will head over to the [Austin Ale House](http://www.theaustinalehouse.com/) for happy hour!

As always, one lucky winner will go home with a great DOOR PRIZE.  We hope to see you in a couple weeks!
