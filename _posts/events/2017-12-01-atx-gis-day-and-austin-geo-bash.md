### ATX GIS day will take place followed by Austin Geo Bash on Tuesday December 12th!
<!--more-->

#### You're invited to take part in the festivities!

**ATX GIS Day** is a forum for geographic information systems (GIS) users to share their knowledge and applications of GIS technology. It provides an opportunity for students of all ages, professionals, businesses and the public to discuss the impact GIS has on our daily lives. Visit the ATX GIS Day website [here](http://atxgisday.org) and [register to attend](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/atx-gis-day-2017-tickets-40806032943).

Following ATX GIS Day, Austin Geo Bash will begin a short distance away from the Austin Central Library (GIS day location). Geo Bash is the Austin geo-community's annual holiday happy hour and charity drive: it is for anyone and everyone in (or near!) Austin who works with, loves, or is learning about all things GEOSPATIAL.

This year's Geo Bash will be located at [BD Riley's on 6th Street](https://bdrileys.com/sixthstreet/), following ATX GIS Day activities.

Attending Geo Bash is FREE, but as always, we encourage attendees to bring a donation for one or both of [SafePlace](http://www.safeaustin.org/get-involved/give/donate/) and the [Central Texas Food Bank](https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/get-involved/donate). We will be collecting monetary donations for both organizations.

All geo-people and their guests are welcome: there will be plenty of geofood, geofun and geofriends, so join us!
