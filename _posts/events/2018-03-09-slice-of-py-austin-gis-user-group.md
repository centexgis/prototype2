<!--more-->

Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) is located in Austin, TX on the J.J. Pickle Research Campus at 10100 Burnet Road. You may enter Pickle Research Campus via Burnet Road. After entering the gated campus, stop and inform the guard that you are a TACC visitor. To get to the Advanced Computing Building (ACB, Building 205), continue past the guard booth, and past the chain link gate to Exploration Way, then make a right. ACB is the second to last building on the right with the overhanging patios.

They have generously offered to give us use of a room and WiFi for the day - all you need to bring is your laptop and your willingness to learn!

**Address:** [10100 Burnet Rd. Austin, TX 78758](https://goo.gl/maps/pd95KtHQQUp) (Within the J.J. Pickle Research campus on Exploration Way.)

Here are the [map and directions](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/about/contact) to TACC.

#### **Parking on the Pickle Research Campus**

When you arrive at ACB, you may park in the covered parking lot or on the street. Please obtain a parking pass from one of the kiosks. Walk up the pathway to the building entrance.
Parking is $4/car with a credit card only. Cash will not be accepted.

**Required:** Bring your wireless-enabled laptop.

Space is limited. Reserve your seat today.

#### **Audience:**

Beginner programmers who have limited or no programming experience.

We’ll set up your development environment on Saturday morning, then introduce you to Python and take breaks to practice concepts. We may break up into pairs when working on a short program filtering and cleaning data from a very large CSV file.

Our goal is to provide an environment in which beginners can develop their programming skills with confidence. You’ll leave with the resources you need to continue your programming education on your own and with your fellow students.
